<h1>A Personal Accomplishment</h1>

<p>One of my most recent personal accomplishments was vending at the “Spring on the Bluff” at the farmhouse on Green Bluff. 
 Working as a vendor hasn’t been successful for me in the past. From bad weather to holiday weekends, I struggled to find 
 success at physical events. However, this was different. Not only did this event feel different from the beginning but I 
 was more prepared and more excited.  I ended the evening with almost no stock left and a full heart. Perhaps this is because
 of my more developed customer service, the event being worked, the gorgeous weather or some combination but regardless my heart 
 was full. </p>
